    <string name="app_name">My CV</string>
    <string name="resume">As a dynamic professional motivated by an interest in technology and
        problem solving, I am seeking new challenges in Android development.\n\n

With experience working with international clients, I have successfully collaborated with
        multi-cultural teams, communicating with adaptability and with a focus
        on teamwork.\n\n

My continuous willingness to learn new things and my aptitude for programming led me to study Kotlin
        and Java, database manipulation, API handling, dependency injection, testing and
        AOSP-related knowledge.\n\n

Knowledge that I want to put into practice after my career transition as a mobile developer</string>
